Revision history for App-SimpleScan

1.05  Fri Apr 28 17:00:27 PDT 2006
	- added --status and tests for it

1.04  Thu Apr 27 17:17:04 PDT 2006
	- fixed tests failing on Solaris (left off specific
	  path to simple_scan - d'oh!)

1.03  Tue Apr 11 14:17:13 PDT 2006
	- mysterious 08cache.t test failure solved!
	- began work on substitution optimization
	- suppressed (finally) the Text::Balanced warnings

1.02  Mon Apr 10 09:51:38 PDT 2006
	- Initial upload failed; trying again

1.01  Fri Mar 31 13:06:43 PST 2006
	- Changed shebang line to use /usr/bin/env
	  (not /home/y, d'oh).

1.00  Fri Mar 17 12:25:43 PST 2006
	- New interfaces deserve a full version update.
	- current_line method added to allow plugins to
	  spy on the input line if they want to.
	- All plugins now converted to use output filters
	  instead of hooking stack_test.
        - More documentation of the base simple_scan 
          program.

0.34  Mon Mar 13 16:21:56 PST 2006
	- totally reorganized variable substitution to fix
	  nested variable substitution problems; variable
	  substitution now returns only the unique tests
	  generated by substituting variables
	- replace per_test with a more flexible filtering
	  architecture
	- dependencies code still under development, so
	  it's still possible to set up an infinite 
          substitution loop, like
             %%foo <bar>
             %%bar <foo>
             <foo>
	  To be fixed in an upcoming release.

0.33  Thu Mar  2 13:57:46 PST 2006
	- expose expand_backticked method
	- reorganize module documentation

0.32  Wed Feb 22 15:47:10 PST 2006
	- Add input queue manipulation to set up for macro-like
	  pragmas and simpler input handling for test spec
	  expansion
	- internal topological sort to resolve possible
	  circular dependencies:
	    %%foo this is <bar>
            %%bar this is <foo>
        - Add code to save current test spec (useful if 
          an overridden method needs to see the current spec)

0.31  Mon Feb 13 13:02:04 PST 2006
	- document that %ENV variables work in substitution pragmas

0.30  Fri Feb 10 15:32:13 PST 2006
	- Change all test and code stacking in App::SimpleScan::Testspec
	  to use stack_test and stack_code so this is consistent
          across core code and plugins.

0.29  Mon Feb  6 16:20:09 PST 2006
        - expanded plugin documentation
	- expanded tests to match new docs

0.28  Mon Feb  6 12:18:21 PST 2006
	- fixed missing default agent_alias

0.27  Thu Jan 26 12:49:14 PST 2006
	- added simple_report to this distribution

0.26  Thu Jan 12 12:05:05 PST 2006
	- added support for backticked and quoted substitutions

0.25  (unreleased)
	- added --no_agent command line option

0.24  (unreleased) 

0.23  Tue Dec  6 17:10:59 PST 2005
	- Reordered code generation so that per_test
	  plugin code gets called every time a test is stacked
        - Added test plugin (t/lib/App/SimpleScan/Plugin/Test_Expand)
	  to properly test substitution expansion
	- Added substitution expansion test to fix a bug
	  that emitted per_test code only for the last test in
	  a set that was created by substitution expansion

0.22  Mon Nov 28 11:01:37 2005
	- Missing prereqs in Makefile.PL corrected

0.21  Mon Nov 21 17:14:07 2005
	- Move test count initialization to prevent an 
	  uninitialized variable warning if a test is stacked by
	  a plugin during the options processing phase. (Is that
	  a specific enough bug or what?)

0.20  Mon Nov 21 17:03:24 2005
  	- Move pragma installation earlier so plugins can find pragma
	processors

0.19  Mon Nov 21 16:09:28 2005 
	- Expose the pragma() method for use by plugins

0.18  Mon Nov 21 14:25:24 2005
	- Made sure that validate_options gets the App::SimpleScan 
	  object

0.17  Fri Nov 18 18:10:34 2005
	- Added conditional callback to validate_options()
	  in plugins; allows plugins to make sure that 
	  command-line option values are indeed valid.

0.16  Fri Nov 18 17:29:12 2005
	- Moved plugin loading into separate private method
	- made stack_tests and stack_code public methods
	  since they were being used publically anyway
	- aliased to _stack_code and _stack_tests until all
	  plugins have time to catch up

0.15  Fri Nov 18 13:39:34 2005
	- Changed the per_test call in App::SimpleScan::Testspec
	  to stack the code *after* the generated test. Note that
	  if a per_test plugin really needs to stack code before
          generated tests by calling _stack_code.

0.14  Fri Nov 18 11:59:58 2005
	- fixed plugin code to only call pragmas() if the plugin
	  can('pragmas'); allows development of options-only plugins

0.13  Thu Nov 17 17:52:43 2005
	- added --autocache option: turn on caching at the beginning
	  of a run

0.12  Tue Nov  8 11:28:14 2005 
	- More changes for accented characters. Now handles either
          UTF-8 or Latin-1. 
	- Eliminated double fetch for accented character tests.

0.11  Wed Oct 26 16:15:52 2005
	- Temporary fix for TODO test until I can figure out
	  why I need to do it at the moment.

0.10  Wed Oct 26 15:29:17 2005
	- Extracted execution of tests into execute() method - 
	  this will allow plugins to override the simple 'eval'
	  with something more interesting
	- fix a quoting error in TY and TN tests

0.09  Wed Oct 26 14:48:27 2005
	- Added --define, --override, --defer, and --debug switches
	- debug is pretty preliminary, but the methods are there now
	- can now define substitutions on the command line, and 
	  choose to have them override or defer to substitutions
	  in input files

0.08  Wed Oct 26 11:37:45 2005
	- Added _delete_substitution to support the %%forget pragma.

0.07  Tue Oct 25 14:37:00 2005
	- Changed match for accented characters to .*? instead
	  of . to make it work consistently on 5.6

0.06  Mon Oct 24 16:24:20 2005
	- fixed "@accents" vs. "$accent[...}" in generated code

0.05  Mon Oct 24 15:55:58 2005
	- Added a missing semicolon on the generated code for the
	  accent extraction line. 

0.04  Mon Oct 24 14:42:38 2005
	- changed 8-bit-character checks; test process seems to nuke
	  the $1, $2, etc. variables, so I can't check them back in
	  the tests itself. Now done via an array of matched-out 
	  characters.
	- Systematized test counting to make sure counts were right
	- Tests now "use strict;"
	- Regex flags handled properly
	- _regex_render added to centralize regex fixups
	- Removed duplicate bottm-out test in substitution recursion
	- Updated tests

0.03  Wed Oct 19 12:22:18 2005
	- altered test spec parsing to properly handle missing comments
	- added tests for this code

0.02  Wed Oct 12 13:55:39 2005
	- Fixed accented character cleanup - wasn't using the
          cleaned-up version of the regex

0.01  Fri Sep 16 11:49:25 2005
	- Initial release.
